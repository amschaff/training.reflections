Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: Adds git artefacts to the directory to begin tracking; prepares for committing & tracking status

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Provides a go-between between the two concepts: allows you to build a commit one piece at a time, such as adding files from multiple directories that may be part of the logical changes; also allows you to keep some files out of the commit set.
